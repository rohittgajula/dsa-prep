48. Rotate Image
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/

Difficulty : Medium
Pattern    : Matrix
Tier       : Core
Scheduled  : Fri 20 Nov 2026  (week 10)

INPUT
    matrix : grid of integers

RETURN
    optimal : nothing is returned - matrix itself is changed
    brute   : may return the finished result instead - the runner
              accepts either

EXAMPLE
    matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    ->  matrix becomes [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]

RECOGNITION HINT  (read only AFTER a real attempt)
    Transpose, then reverse each row. Derive that decomposition rather
    than memorising it.

BRUTE FORCE
    <state it the way you would say it out loud in an interview>
    Time  : O(?)
    Space : O(?)

OPTIMAL
    <what does it exploit that the brute force wastes?>
    Time  : O(?)
    Space : O(?)

KEY INSIGHT
    <the one sentence that makes this collapse>

MISTAKES I MADE
